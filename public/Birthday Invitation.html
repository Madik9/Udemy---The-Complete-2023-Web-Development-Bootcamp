<h2>But that's not all we're celebrating...</h2>
<p>Due to graduating in 2020, I never got a closing ceremony, and never got the chance to celebrate my accomplishment of completing my degree. So I'm using my birthday this year to not only celebrate the day of my birth, but everything else I missed out on.</p>

<h3>What all are we celebrating?</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>My special day, of course!</li>
        <li>Gradutaing college</li>
        <li>Securing my first fulltime position</li>
        <li>Buying my first (and second) car</li>
        <li>Moving into my first apartment</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Gift Registry</h3>
<p>I saw a tweet recently that said that women shouldn't only be celebrated and gifted things for weddings and motherhood. And I completely agree. In fact, I've taken that sentiment and ran with it. So here's an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/27IK1ULAXO2BW/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_3" target="_blank"> amazon wishlist</a> of random things I've gathered over the years. There's no pressure to get anything of course! Your friendship/love is enough for me.</p>
