<h1>My Top 3 Favorite Animated Movies</h1>
<h2>I'm a huge fan of animation so this list will focus on animated movies only.</h2>

<h3>Anything Hayao Miyazaki</h3>
    <p>So I know I just said it was only going to be three movies, but I appreciate too many of Miyazaki's movies not to include all of them. I will list my most favorites of his though, in no particular order.:
        <ul>
            <li>Spirited Away</li>
            <li>Howl's Moving Castle</li>
            <li>Whisper of the Heart</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
<h3>Chicken Little</h3>
    <p>Top tier, really under appreciated retelling of the classic story of a chicken being hit on the head with an acorn and believing the sky is falling.</p>
<h3>The Princess and the Frog</h3>
    <p>There was one point in time where I had this entire movie memorized front to back and could recite it with correct timing and everything. Love the story, LOVE the music, and love the black main character.</p>
